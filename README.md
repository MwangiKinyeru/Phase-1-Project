##### Description of data

###### The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters.
##### Generally, a preliminary report is available online within a few days of an accident. Factual information is added when available, and when the investigation is completed, the preliminary report is replaced with a final description of the accident and its probable cause. Full narrative descriptions may not be available for dates before 1993, cases under revision, or where NTSB did not have primary investigative responsibility. This information can be found at the link in the data source.

For higher-risk purposes, they should investigate further to understand the causes and explore additional safety measures or select aircraft models that perform better in those contexts.

##### The organization should consider purchasing aircraft models with higher counts of uninjured passengers, as these models have demonstrated better safety performance. It is also recommended to cross-reference this data with overall incident rates and severity to ensure a comprehensive assessment.
